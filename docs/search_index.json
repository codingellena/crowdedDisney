Here we study the waiting time of Walt Disney World, which contains the following five different parks: Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Disney’s Animal Kingdom, Disney’s Hollywood Studios and Walt Disney World. 2.2 Basic information The webpage contains a metadata, providing basic information for each day of operation. This includes date, ticket price type(value, regular, peak), season, temperature of the day, event, etc. The third hyperlink (Facts) contains information about the average waiting time and the duration of each attraction. The dataset has a date range from 01/01/2015 to 08/31/2021. Besides these, we use waiting times for the selected attractions listed in the separated files. The data is collected on a continuous basis every day, which allows us study the waiting time based on time of the day. The date range is from 01/01/2015 to 12/28/2021. In addition, we also use the entities dataset, which describes the waiting times and duration of 95 attractions. The waiting time is measured through calculating the average waiting time per hundred persons. The duration describes the time it takes for a ride, which we believe have a strong relationship with the user’s experience. The waiting time and duration are both in minutes. 2.3 Foreseeing issues or problems There are many missing values in metadata and the missing seems to be periodically. For example, the feature measuring ticket price only have values from 02/28/2016 to 06/29/2019, although the dataset has a date range from 01/01/2015 to 08/31/2021. Besides, in attraction specific files, there exists a missing pattern between the feature waiting time post and actual waiting time, which is, when one feature has value, the other would miss value. These missing patterns make it difficult to do data visualization and data analysis. We will address these problems in the data transformation and missing value sections. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Metadata 3.2 Attraction specific data 3.3 Entities dataset", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Metadata For the metadata dataset, we filter out the features that we will use for visualization from the total 149 columns, focusing on date, ticket price, holiday type, temperature and event information. The date data is transformed into “%m/%d/%Y” format, which help us address it. ## # A tibble: 6 × 16 ## DATE WDW_TICKET_SEASON DAYOFWEEK DAYOFYEAR WEEKOFYEAR MONTHOFYEAR YEAR ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2015-01-01 &lt;NA&gt; 5 0 0 1 2015 ## 2 2015-01-02 &lt;NA&gt; 6 1 0 1 2015 ## 3 2015-01-03 &lt;NA&gt; 7 2 0 1 2015 ## 4 2015-01-04 &lt;NA&gt; 1 3 1 1 2015 ## 5 2015-01-05 &lt;NA&gt; 2 4 1 1 2015 ## 6 2015-01-06 &lt;NA&gt; 3 5 1 1 2015 ## # … with 9 more variables: HOLIDAYPX &lt;dbl&gt;, HOLIDAYM &lt;dbl&gt;, HOLIDAY &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # WDWMEANTEMP &lt;dbl&gt;, WDWeventN &lt;chr&gt;, MKeventN &lt;chr&gt;, EPeventN &lt;chr&gt;, ## # HSeventN &lt;chr&gt;, AKeventN &lt;chr&gt; 3.2 Attraction specific data For the attraction specific datasets, the data is collected randomly nearly every 10 minutes. This also arise the problem of providing too many data points with about 110 rows each day. We transform the data into the tidy data by different level (hour, day, month, year). Besides, we notice that the date in attraction specific datasets is not continuous, there is missing date from 03/14/2020 to 06/26/2020 and from 06/28/2020 to 07/07/2020, from 07/21/2020 to 10/30/2020 and from 01/02/2021 to 04/29/2021. The reasonfor missing is that Disney World was closed in those days because of the Covid-19 pandemic. To address this problem, we fill the DATE to be complete according to the nature of date. Finally, we combine the 13 attraction specific data into one dataset, which may provide the option for us to make comparation between different attractions on the same date, and we may also facet on different attractions. ## date year month weekday weekend soarin avatar dinosaur ee safari ## 1 2015-01-01 2015 1 Thu FALSE 89.81481 NA 31.15385 40.26882 29.27632 ## 2 2015-01-02 2015 1 Fri FALSE 82.38971 NA 26.63158 34.19811 34.15584 ## 3 2015-01-03 2015 1 Sat TRUE 73.44340 NA 26.87500 29.79381 19.55128 ## 4 2015-01-04 2015 1 Sun TRUE 58.06931 NA 18.72449 23.85000 16.47887 ## 5 2015-01-05 2015 1 Mon FALSE 58.43750 NA 23.87931 26.95652 14.39394 ## 6 2015-01-06 2015 1 Tue FALSE 55.93750 NA 18.53846 26.66667 16.19403 ## navi pirate rnrc sevendwarf slinkydog spaceship splash toystory ## 1 NA 46.13636 74.71774 114.34959 NA 34.58333 29.73485 85.03937 ## 2 NA 36.29139 80.08065 113.45638 NA 26.70543 43.94366 88.20833 ## 3 NA 30.26119 88.22222 102.44094 NA 25.62500 43.23529 79.69298 ## 4 NA 19.70370 5.00000 80.72000 NA 20.34314 29.47761 77.03297 ## 5 NA 29.35185 62.32143 87.37069 NA 17.28723 5.00000 74.00990 ## 6 NA 24.48454 61.42857 79.61538 NA 14.86607 NA 71.91860 3.3 Entities dataset For the entities dataset, we add a new column ratio to the dataset by calculating waiting time/duration. Besides, the orignal name of the attractions is very long, so we use the short name column instead of the name column. After that, we filter out the column that is useful for the visualization (short_name, land, ratio). ## # A tibble: 6 × 3 ## short_name land ratio ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 It&#39;s Tough to Be a Bug Discovery Island 1.5 ## 2 Kilimanjaro Safaris Africa 0.2 ## 3 Expedition Everest Asia 1 ## 4 Kali River Rapids Asia 0.5 ## 5 DINOSAUR DinoLand U.S.A. 0.86 ## 6 TriceraTop Spin DinoLand U.S.A. 6.67 "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing patterns 4.2 Assessment of impact", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing patterns For the dates, the data file has missing data from 03/14/2020 to 06/26/2020 and from 06/28/2020 to 07/07/2020, from 07/21/2020 to 10/30/2020 and from 01/02/2021 to 04/29/2021, and incomplete data from 05/04/2021 to 06/12/2021. This is also shown in the missing plot graphed below. We did a transformation step before making the miss plot - we fill the DATE to be complete according to the nature of date. The date that are filled through the transformation as a result has missing value for all other features and they account for about 20% of the total data. Columns related to events (WDWeventN, MKeventN, EPeventN, HSeventN, AKeventN) have a number of missing value at percentage ranging from 55% to 95%. AKeventN is the feature that has the most missing value, for about 95%. From the second plot, we may also recognize that the events data tend to be missing together and the other missing patterns are not obvious. The columns depicts ticket price (WDW_TICKET_SEASON) only have data from 02/28/2016 to 06/29/2019. Besides, the other features except date have a similar missing rate at about 18%. From the second plot, there are about 50% of the data do not have missing value. There is a trend that WDWSEASON is missing only when WDWTICKETSEASON is missing. For variable mean temperature(“WDWMEANTEMP”), there are six missing values, which are 11/25/2016, 12/09/2016, 01/05/2017, 04/03/2017, 04/14/2017, 04/30/2017. 4.2 Assessment of impact The reason for missing is that Disney World was closed from Mar 15, 2020 to 07/10/2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. And even until today, the pandemic has an effect on the crowdedness of Disney World. Thus the missing data of the dates mentioned above do not have a large effect on our final project because we have a very large data set with time range of 7 years. Besides the date, the feature for ticket price is not continuously documented for unknown reasons. we only have data from 02/28/2016 to 06/29/2019. However, this would not have large impact on our final project because we want to address the dependent relationship between day of week and the ticket price and the data we have now is enough for the analysis. For the missing data regarding events, it does not hurt either because we are mainly mapping the proportion of different events rather than analyze them in respect to the date. To sum up, the missing dates after the pandemic may have an effect on our analysis of the crowd of Disney World. However, since we have a huge data set from 2015 to 2021, we still have enough data to analyze and give conclusive results. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Waiting time analysis 5.2 Ticket price 5.3 Waiting-duration ratio 5.4 Events in Disney", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Waiting time analysis In order to have a general idea of the waiting time for different attractions along the year, I choose to map the data of year 2019, since in this way there is no time gaps in the plots. Among different attractions, Avatar was the most popular attractions in 2019, which required the longest waiting time for about 100 min-175 min. Its waiting time was significantly longer than the others. Spaceship, pirate and dinosaur are the three attractions with the least waiting time for about 20 min-40 min. Besides, there exists an interesting trend that the waiting time for each attraction seems to decrease gradually from January to September and then increase from September to December. The only exception is the attraction Splash, which has an opposing pattern. The peak waiting time for Splash is around August. It is reasonable since Splash is having a ride over water, therefore people would like to play it more in summer rather than in winter. It is a good choice to visit Disney in September which yields the shortest waiting time in most attractions over the year. To map the relationship between the waiting time and weekday, I make the chart above using the waiting time of attraction Soarin in July 2021. The plot shows that the waiting time has a pattern of having longer waiting time in weekdays and shorter waiting time on weekends which is oppose to the common sense. The waiting time reaches its peak on 8th, 21st, 27th, 28th July which are mainly Tuesday-Thursday and reaches its minimum mainly on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. My assumption for this pattern is Disney tends to close some of the attractions for some time in weekdays but fully open on weekends. 5.2 Ticket price There were 3 ticket price types, peak,regular and value, and in a particular day there was only one ticket type. Among all days, regular tickets account for the most proportion, which means people are most likely to get a regular price ticket. From Tuesday to Friday, the proportion of ticket price were similar, besides regular ticket, the proportion of value price ticket is more than peak price ticket. In Saturday, Sunday and Monday, the ticket is more likely to assigned as peak price than the other days and a value price ticket is harder to get. 5.3 Waiting-duration ratio We pay special attention on the line of waiting time/duration ratio = 1, which means one can enjoy the event with the same waiting time. The waiting time in more than half of the events in Cleveland Disney were less than playing time. However in the popular events, the waiting time were significantly at least 3 times more than playing time. The first 3 popular events, the waiting time were even 9 times more than playing times. 5.4 Events in Disney Comparing between different parks, Epcot holds the most events than the other parks. Epcot International Flower &amp; Garden Festival (epfg) and Epcot International Food &amp; Wine Festival (epfw) are the top 2 events that holds the most in Disney. They are both from Epcot and holds at least two times than other events. Magic Kindom is the park that provide the most various type of events. It provides Disney Early Morning Magic(emm), Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party(mnsshp), Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party(mvmcp), Disney After Hours(dah), etc. If we would like to join various events, we may pay more attention to Magic Kindom’s schedule and Magic Kindom can be a better choice. Besides, Animal Kingdom is the park that holds the least events. Therefore, as toursist, we may expect fewer events hold in Animal Kingdom then others when visiting Disney. #Interactive Click this link to try: https://vizhub.com/evadai55/cc4cacf3bbdf431f9d25d60b61da410d?edit=files&amp;file=index.html&amp;mode=full "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
