This is the Eva Dai and Yixuan Zhang from STAT GR5293 Statistical Graphics of Columbia University, SPRING 2022. In this project, we will focus on the question of crowdedness of Disney World using graphical techniques we learned in this class. Walt Disney World has always been a popular site for vacation for children and adults. The four parks in Disney World have all kinds of rides for you to choose! However, waiting time is always concern for the prospective visitors. Wondering what month will be the best to visit without a long line for each ride? Or thinking about visiting on weekdays to avoid the crowd? In this final project, we will tell you some hidden patterns of the waiting time of some popular rides in Walt Disney World located in Orlando. Hope this can help to plan your next visit! In this project, we have selected 12 classic rides from the four parks of Walt Disney World: Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom. We will use graphical techniques such as bar chart, multiple boxplot, time series plot, biplot, histogram, and interactive plot to analyze not only the waiting time patterns of individual rides, but also waiting patterns of the entire park based on hour, day, month or year. You will definitely get some unexpected conclusions after reading this project! "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Data link 2.2 Basic information 2.3 Foreseeing issues or problems", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Data link Data Link https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/crowd-calendar#DataSets We get this open data set from touringplans.com, which is a website that monitor the crowd level in both Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Here we study the waiting time of Walt Disney World, which contains the following five different parks: Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Disney’s Animal Kingdom, Disney’s Hollywood Studios and Walt Disney World. 2.2 Basic information The webpage contains a metadata, providing basic information for each day of operation. This includes date, ticket price type(value, regular, peak), season, temperature of the day, event, etc. The third hyperlink (Facts) contains information about the average waiting time and the duration of each attraction. The dataset has a date range from 01/01/2015 to 08/31/2021. Besides these, we use waiting times for the selected attractions listed in the separated files. The data is collected on a continuous basis every day, which allows us study the waiting time based on time of the day. The date range is from 01/01/2015 to 12/28/2021. In addition, we also use the entities dataset, which describes the waiting times and duration of 95 attractions. The waiting time is measured through calculating the average waiting time per hundred persons. The duration describes the time it takes for a ride, which we believe have a strong relationship with the user’s experience. The waiting time and duration are both in minutes. 2.3 Foreseeing issues or problems There are many missing values in metadata and the missing seems to be periodically. For example, the feature measuring ticket price only have values from 02/28/2016 to 06/29/2019, although the dataset has a date range from 01/01/2015 to 08/31/2021. Besides, in attraction specific files, there exists a missing pattern between the feature waiting time post and actual waiting time, which is, when one feature has value, the other would miss value. These missing patterns make it difficult to do data visualization and data analysis. We will address these problems in the data transformation and missing value sections. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Metadata 3.2 Attraction specific data 3.3 Entities dataset", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Metadata For the metadata dataset, we filter out the features that we will use for visualization from the total 149 columns, focusing on date, ticket price, holiday type, temperature and event information. The date data is transformed into “%m/%d/%Y” format, which help us address it. ## # A tibble: 6 × 17 ## DATE WDW_TICKET_SEASON DAYOFWEEK DAYOFYEAR WEEKOFYEAR MONTHOFYEAR YEAR HOLIDAYPX HOLIDAYM HOLIDAY ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2015-01-01 &lt;NA&gt; 5 0 0 1 2015 0 5 1 ## 2 2015-01-02 &lt;NA&gt; 6 1 0 1 2015 2 5 0 ## 3 2015-01-03 &lt;NA&gt; 7 2 0 1 2015 3 0 0 ## 4 2015-01-04 &lt;NA&gt; 1 3 1 1 2015 4 0 0 ## 5 2015-01-05 &lt;NA&gt; 2 4 1 1 2015 5 0 0 ## 6 2015-01-06 &lt;NA&gt; 3 5 1 1 2015 6 0 0 ## # … with 7 more variables: WDWMEANTEMP &lt;dbl&gt;, WDWeventN &lt;chr&gt;, MKeventN &lt;chr&gt;, EPeventN &lt;chr&gt;, HSeventN &lt;chr&gt;, ## # AKeventN &lt;chr&gt;, WDWSEASON &lt;chr&gt; 3.2 Attraction specific data For the attraction specific datasets, the data is collected randomly nearly every 10 minutes. This also arise the problem of providing too many data points with about 110 rows each day. We transform the data into the tidy data by different level (hour, day, month, year). Besides, we notice that the date in attraction specific datasets is not continuous, there is missing date from 03/14/2020 to 06/26/2020 and from 06/28/2020 to 07/07/2020, from 07/21/2020 to 10/30/2020 and from 01/02/2021 to 04/29/2021. The reasonfor missing is that Disney World was closed in those days because of the Covid-19 pandemic. To address this problem, we fill the DATE to be complete according to the nature of date. Finally, we combine the 13 attraction specific data into one dataset, which may provide the option for us to make comparation between different attractions on the same date, and we may also facet on different attractions. ## date year month weekofmonth weekday weekend soarin avatar dinosaur ee safari navi pirate ## 1 2015-01-01 2015 1 1 Thu FALSE 89.81481 NA 31.15385 40.26882 29.27632 NA 46.13636 ## 2 2015-01-02 2015 1 1 Fri FALSE 82.38971 NA 26.63158 34.19811 34.15584 NA 36.29139 ## 3 2015-01-03 2015 1 1 Sat TRUE 73.44340 NA 26.87500 29.79381 19.55128 NA 30.26119 ## 4 2015-01-04 2015 1 2 Sun TRUE 58.06931 NA 18.72449 23.85000 16.47887 NA 19.70370 ## 5 2015-01-05 2015 1 2 Mon FALSE 58.43750 NA 23.87931 26.95652 14.39394 NA 29.35185 ## 6 2015-01-06 2015 1 2 Tue FALSE 55.93750 NA 18.53846 26.66667 16.19403 NA 24.48454 ## rnrc sevendwarf slinkydog spaceship splash toystory ## 1 74.71774 114.34959 NA 34.58333 29.73485 85.03937 ## 2 80.08065 113.45638 NA 26.70543 43.94366 88.20833 ## 3 88.22222 102.44094 NA 25.62500 43.23529 79.69298 ## 4 5.00000 80.72000 NA 20.34314 29.47761 77.03297 ## 5 62.32143 87.37069 NA 17.28723 5.00000 74.00990 ## 6 61.42857 79.61538 NA 14.86607 NA 71.91860 3.3 Entities dataset For the entities dataset, we add a new column ratio to the dataset by calculating waiting time/duration. Besides, the orignal name of the attractions is very long, so we use the short name column instead of the name column. After that, we filter out the column that is useful for the visualization (short_name, land, ratio). ## # A tibble: 6 × 3 ## short_name land ratio ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 It&#39;s Tough to Be a Bug Discovery Island 1.5 ## 2 Kilimanjaro Safaris Africa 0.2 ## 3 Expedition Everest Asia 1 ## 4 Kali River Rapids Asia 0.5 ## 5 DINOSAUR DinoLand U.S.A. 0.86 ## 6 TriceraTop Spin DinoLand U.S.A. 6.67 ## mean1 mean2 mean3 ## 1 37.66019 77.68942 66.36261 "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing patterns 4.2 Assessment of impact", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing patterns For the dates, the data file has missing data from 03/14/2020 to 06/26/2020 and from 06/28/2020 to 07/07/2020, from 07/21/2020 to 10/30/2020 and from 01/02/2021 to 04/29/2021, and incomplete data from 05/04/2021 to 06/12/2021. This is also shown in the missing plot graphed below. We did a transformation step before making the miss plot - we fill the DATE to be complete according to the nature of date. The date that are filled through the transformation as a result has missing value for all other features and they account for about 20% of the total data. Columns related to events (WDWeventN, MKeventN, EPeventN, HSeventN, AKeventN) have a number of missing value at percentage ranging from 55% to 95%. AKeventN is the feature that has the most missing value, for about 95%. From the second plot, we may also recognize that the events data tend to be missing together and the other missing patterns are not obvious. The columns depicts ticket price (WDW_TICKET_SEASON) only have data from 02/28/2016 to 06/29/2019. Besides, the other features except date have a similar missing rate at about 18%. From the second plot, there are about 50% of the data do not have missing value. There is a trend that WDWSEASON is missing only when WDWTICKETSEASON is missing. For variable mean temperature(“WDWMEANTEMP”), there are six missing values, which are 11/25/2016, 12/09/2016, 01/05/2017, 04/03/2017, 04/14/2017, 04/30/2017. 4.2 Assessment of impact The reason for missing is that Disney World was closed from Mar 15, 2020 to 07/10/2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. And even until today, the pandemic has an effect on the crowdedness of Disney World. Thus the missing data of the dates mentioned above do not have a large effect on our final project because we have a very large data set with time range of 7 years. Besides the date, the feature for ticket price is not continuously documented for unknown reasons. we only have data from 02/28/2016 to 06/29/2019. However, this would not have large impact on our final project because we want to address the dependent relationship between day of week and the ticket price and the data we have now is enough for the analysis. For the missing data regarding events, it does not hurt either because we are mainly mapping the proportion of different events rather than analyze them in respect to the date. To sum up, the missing dates after the pandemic may have an effect on our analysis of the crowd of Disney World. However, since we have a huge data set from 2015 to 2021, we still have enough data to analyze and give conclusive results.

Among different attractions, Avatar was the most popular attractions in 2019, which required the longest waiting time for about 100 min-175 min. Its waiting time was significantly longer than the others. Spaceship, pirate and dinosaur are the three attractions with the least waiting time for about 20 min-40 min. Besides, there exists an interesting trend that the waiting time for each attraction seems to decrease gradually from January to September and then increase from September to December. The only exception is the attraction Splash, which has an opposing pattern. The peak waiting time for Splash is around August. It is reasonable since Splash is having a ride over water, therefore people would like to play it more in summer rather than in winter. It is a good choice to visit Disney in September which yields the shortest waiting time in most attractions over the year. To map the relationship between the waiting time and weekday, I make the chart above using the waiting time of attraction Soarin in July 2021. The plot shows that the waiting time has a pattern of having longer waiting time in weekdays and shorter waiting time on weekends which is oppose to the common sense. The waiting time reaches its peak on 8th, 21st, 27th, 28th July which are mainly Tuesday-Thursday and reaches its minimum mainly on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. My assumption for this pattern is Disney tends to close some of the attractions for some time in weekdays but fully open on weekends. 5.2 Ticket price There were 3 ticket price types, peak,regular and value, and in a particular day there was only one ticket type. Among all days, regular tickets account for the most proportion, which means people are most likely to get a regular price ticket. From Tuesday to Friday, the proportion of ticket price were similar, besides regular ticket, the proportion of value price ticket is more than peak price ticket. In Saturday, Sunday and Monday, the ticket is more likely to assigned as peak price than the other days and a value price ticket is harder to get. 5.3 Waiting-duration ratio We pay special attention on the line of waiting time/duration ratio = 1, which means one can enjoy the event with the same waiting time. The waiting time in more than half of the events in Cleveland Disney were less than playing time. However in the popular events, the waiting time were significantly at least 3 times more than playing time. The first 3 popular events, the waiting time were even 9 times more than playing times. 5.4 Events in Disney 5.5 Seven Dwarf Mining Train waiting time calendar heatmap This is a calendar heat map for the waiting time of Seven Dwarf Mining Train, a popular ride located in Magic Kingdom of Walt Disney World. From the calendar heat map for the “Seven Dwarf Mining Train” ride of Disney World, we can easily see which days have a high average waiting time and which days have a low waiting time. And by comparing different levels of color fill over years, we can see the overall waiting pattern during a year and find which months have lower average waiting time. And we can also compare across years to see the overall crowdedness of the year. For instance, the color fills for year 2021 are lighter than the other years, which can be considered directly impacted by the current pandemic. The grey colors represent the missing data, since Disney was impacted by Covid-19 and closed from Mar to July in 2021. Some of the data are missing after then. If we compare across all the years, 2018 and 2019 seem to be the more crowded years. Some peaks in waiting time appear in early January(winter break) and mid March(spring break), as well as late December (Christmas). The averages of waiting time reach the maximum of the spectrum, with a value of around 150 minutes. And in year 2021, when Covid is more under control, the average waiting time is relatively short from March to May, and gradually increases when summer break starts. And the waiting time decreases again from mid August to September, and increases again in October. However, compared with years before covid, the fill colors are much lighter, meaning that the average waiting time of the ride is shorter. 5.6 Multiple Boxplot of year 2019 This is a multiple box plot of the selected 12 rides in Walt Disney World in Orlando. Because of the pandemic, Disney World was closed from Mar 15 to Jul 10 in 2020. As a consequence, the waiting time data of year 2020 was of less importance of our study and we chose the data of year 2019 and 2021 for comparison. The ride names of the abbreviations can be found in the data folder. The plot shows the overall distribution of the average waiting of the selected 12 rides, ordered by their medians. The four different colors stand for the four parks that each ride is located. The statistics of each ride is computed from hourly waiting time averages, from Jan 1 to Dec 31. Comparing the distribution of all rides of the two years, we can see that the average waiting times in 2021 are slightly lower than in 2019. The interquartile ranges of most rides, such as avatar, slinky dog, seven dwarf mining train, splash mountain, and Expedition Everest, have decreasing trends. This may indicate that there are fewer visitors compared with 2019. One possible reason is that the pandemic is still ongoing, compared with 2019 where there were no infection concerns. What’s more, the medians of most rides also decrease. The ride with the largest drop in median is Avatar Flight of Passage, located in Animal Kingdom. In 2019, the median is about 125 minutes. However, in year 2021, the median largely decreases to 70 minutes. Apart from Avatar, the order of the rides by median also changes across years. Seven Dwarf Mining Train changes from the second place in 2019, with a median of 80 minutes to the third place in 2021, with a median of 60 minutes. The ride “Slinky dog” has a slight decrease of 80 minutes in 2019 to 70 minutes in 2021, but it moves from the fourth place in 2019 to the second place in 2021. And this is mainly caused by the relatively larger decreases in median of other rides. We can see that all the rides have outliers in the right tails, meaning that there are lots of occurrences with waiting time much longer than usual. This may happen during holiday seasons. Indeed, Avatar has the longest waiting time out of all attractions, with a waiting of around 350 minutes in 2019! Besides, rides such as seven dwarf mining train, Rock’n’Roller Roaster and Splash Mountain have extreme outliers on the right end, which are far from the interquartile range. The distribution of waiting time of these 12 rides are mostly right skewed. This means that most of the shorter waiting times are clustered together, while the longer ones are more scattered. Rides such as dinosaur and spaceship in year 2021 are especially showing these patterns since they have very short waiting times. When trying to order the boxplot facets by median of the two different year, we met the problem that the order doesn’t change when using reorder() function. Thanks to the contribution from Dave Robinson on Github for this useful function so that we can reorder the facet boxplots by their medians separately! The reorder_within() and scale_x_reordered() function comes from : https://github.com/dgrtwo/drlib/blob/master/R/reorder_within.R 5.7 Seven Dwarf Mining Train Weekend/Weekday Pattern Before studying this dataset, we always believed that waiting time on weekends are longer than on weekdays. The reason is that children are off school and adults are off work on weekends, thus there will be more people in the park. However, when exploring our data, we are shocked that sometimes the waiting time at weekends are shorter than on weekdays. And this raises our attention and thus we decide to explore more on that. Our first guess is that this is just the pattern of a given year since we were looking at the data of year 2021. However, when we plot the average yearly data, we find that the waiting time on weekends is still longer than on weekdays. And thus our second hypothesis is that this is a pattern of summer break. As we all know, the main target audience of Disney World are children and teenagers. Thus we guess that children can visit the park on weekdays, resulting in the lower average waiting time on weekends. As a consequence, we use data from 2015 to 2021 to calculate the average monthly waiting time. From this graph, we can see that apparently our guessing is right. Weekend average waiting time are shorter than weekdays in June, July and August, which are the months of summer break. And this is not only limited to the Seven Dwarf Mining Train ride, but also on many other popular rides as we can see in the following interactive plot. And in terms of the waiting of time of the day, we can see that the waits are usually shorter at morning and at night, and are relatively higher from 10 am to 17pm. Thus if you want to skip the long line, try to get up and early and be the first one to go in, or you can stay up late and join the line before the park closes. 5.8 Biplot on attraction waiting time and season A biplot is constructed using Singular Value Decomposition, and is a graphing technique to help us understand relationship between variables. In biplots, the directions of each variable’s axis matter rather than the length of the axis, and the values can be read by projecting onto the axis of the variable. Moreover, points that are clustered together represent close correlations. Similarly, arrows that have similar orientations represent close correlations. This biplot uses waiting data of the selected 12 rides to perform PCA calculations. For data, we used daily average waiting time of the rides with a time range of Jan 1 2015 to Dec 31 2021. The arrows represent the different rides, where the points represent different holiday seasons. The seasons include popular seasons such as Christmas peak, Summer Break, Easter, Columbus day, but also off-peaks such as winter, spring, September low, etc. By using a biplot, we can clearly see the relationship between different rides and seasons. The graph shows a key axis for Seven Dwarf Mining Train, which is a popular ride located in Magic Kingdom. The projections of each season on the axis represent the average waiting time during each season. For instance, we can see that Christmas peak has the longest waiting time, with an average of 110 minutes. And September low has the shortest average time for around 60 minutes. Many other seasons are clustered together, ranging from 70 to 95 minutes. We can also see that the arrow of ride Navigator River Journey is orthogonal to Seven Dwarf Mining Train, which shows that waiting of the two rides are not correlated. Other uncorrelated rides examples are Splash Mountain with rides such as Expedition Everest, Toy Story Mania, etc. As we can see, there are many clusters of the axes, showing a close relationship of these rides. For instance, Pirates of the Carribean, Slinky Dog Dash, Rock n Roller Roaster and Seven Dwarf Mining Train are clustered together, while Avatar Flight of Passage and Kilimanjaro Safaris form another cluster. And in terms of the holiday seasons, seasons such as summer break and Jul 4th, spring are clustered together, and peak holidays such as Columbus Day, Christmas, Presidents Week have another cluster. By looking at the biplot, we can clearly understand the relationship between rides and season. If you want to study more on biplot: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biplot 5.9 Events in Disney Comparing between different parks, Epcot holds the most events than the other parks. Epcot International Flower &amp; Garden Festival (epfg) and Epcot International Food &amp; Wine Festival (epfw) are the top 2 events that holds the most in Disney. They are both from Epcot and holds at least two times than other events. Magic Kindom is the park that provide the most various type of events. It provides Disney Early Morning Magic(emm), Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party(mnsshp), Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party(mvmcp), Disney After Hours(dah), etc. If we would like to join various events, we may pay more attention to Magic Kindom’s schedule and Magic Kindom can be a better choice. Besides, Animal Kingdom is the park that holds the least events. Therefore, as toursist, we may expect fewer events hold in Animal Kingdom then others when visiting Disney. When plotting this graph, we tried to use event frequency in each park as a factor to analyze its relationship with average waiting time of the rides in each park. However, our analysis show that there is not a clear relationship between the two. It shows that visitors’ decisions to visit the park do not depend on the events. 5.10 Park waiting pattern before and after Covid This graph shows the relationship between average waiting time and month, with respect to years and different parks. As mentioned before, Disney was closed from mid March to Jul 10 in year 2020 because of Covid-19, thus we have some missing data in year 2020. In order to show the change of waiting pattern before and after Covid-19, we selected data from year 2019 and 2021, and use bar plots here to visualize the average waiting times for different months. First of all, when comparing across rows, we can see that the waiting averages have different patterns for the four parks. Among these parks, Epcot has the shortest waiting time for approximately 30 minutes on average. The waiting pattern is quite uniform but a low in September for 2019, and the average slightly decreases after Covid, with a low of around 15 minutes in August and September in 2021. Among the four parks, Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios are relatively popular in 2019, with waiting time averages around 60 minutes. The average waiting time decreases to around 30 minutes after Covid. In general, the two parks have very similar waiting time distributions in 2019 and 2021. And for Magic Kingdom, the average waiting time remains similar from 2019 to 2021, with an average around 60 minutes in 2019, and a slight decrease to average of 45 minutes after Covid. The relatively small decrease in waiting average compared to other parks may arise from the fact that the main audience of Magic Kingdom are children, while the others are more targeting towards adults and teenagers. And when looking at the monthly patterns, we can see that September is the month with the lowest waiting time for all parks and all years, while March, June, July and and August have higher waiting time averages than other months. In 2019, March is a high month, while July in 2021 have higher averages. By analyzing this graph, we recommend anyone who are planning to visit Disney World, and are free to choose from all months, to visit there in September since there is a pattern that Septembers have shorter waiting times on average. And we can clearly see that crowd of Disney World greatly decrease after Covid.

Or wondering the waiting time is shorter on weekdays? Visit this link to study the waiting pattern! Here is a visualization of the real waiting time of some popular rides in Jul 2021. From this graph, you can see average daily waiting time of each ride of Jul 2021. The graph also tells information such as date, day of week, temperature of the day, as well as mean waiting time of the month. We selected three classic rides in Magic Kingdom: Pirates of the Caribbean, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Splash Mountain. We used to believe that waiting time on weekends are usually longer than on weekdays. However, from our analysis, we found an interesting fact that the waiting time at weekends are actually shorter. Thus if you are planning to visit Disney World this summer, we recommend you to go on weekends, and preferably early July since the waiting averages are lower. Given the past data of Jul 2021, the average waiting time is around 38 minutes for “Pirates of the Caribbean”, 78 minutes for “Seven Dwarf Mining Train” and 66 minutes for “Splash Mountain”. Thus if you are in the park and see the posted waiting time shorter than these numbers, just join the line! "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion After reading all these graphs, does our analysis give you a brand new understanding on amusement park crowd pattern? Hopefully this can help you with planning your next visit to Walt Disney World! To conclude, we find that popular rides usually have larger waiting-duration ratios. And the waiting patterns perform differently in different months. Among all months, September usually has the shortest wait, while March, June and August have longer waits. And from our comparison of crowd between 2019 and 2021, we can see that the medians of the rides mostly decrease after Covid. Given the current pandemic, there are fewer visitors in Walt Disney World. Thus if you are interested in visiting there, this may be a good opportunity with a shorter wait. But remember to wear masks and stay safe! And in terms of weekend and weekday, the weekend means are usually lower than weekday means during summer break, namely June to August, but are higher in other months. Another reason is that since most people spend a whole week or more in Orlando, weekends and weekdays do not make a huge difference in Disney World, when compared with other places such as Disneyland in California. And if you want to skip the long line, try to get up early to catch the park opening or stay up late and join the line before the park closes. However, there are still some limitations of the project. First of all, since the dataset from the original source is huge and time range spans from 2015 to 2021, there are some missing values for a number of days. And given the fact that Disney was closed due to Covid-19 in 2020, this may create some inconsistency of our analysis. What’s more, it is sometimes cumbersome to calculate statistics needed for graphing because we need to transform hundred thousand rows of data into a single average value. Thus the transformations of the data take a lot time when were are pre-processing them. Secondly, the data is only up to Dec 31 2021, thus we are unable to see the trends of the current months in 2022. And given the continuously evolving Covid virus variants, the crowd data after 2020 may not give perfect information because of the usual outbreaks of Covid cases. A possible future improvement to our analysis is to connect Covid cases data to the crowd data of Disney World and study the effect of the pandemic on crowd level. And this may require some linear regression techniques besides the graphing techniques we learned in class. The study on the crowd data of Walt Disney World provides us with a thorough understanding of amusement park waiting time. This project not only helps us strengthen our skills of graphing using R and D3, but also provides an opportunity to study the topic that we are interested in. And we hope this project can give you some insights on the crowd of Disney World.
