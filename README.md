## Project Title: How crowded is Disney?

Eva Dai, Yixuan Zhang

### Project Description

We get this open data set from touringplans.com, which is a website that monitor the crowd level in both Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Here we study the waiting time of Walt Disney World.

The webpage contains a metadata, providing basic information for each day of operation. This includes date, ticket price type(value, saving, peak), season, temperature of the day, event, etc. The third hyperlink (Facts) contains information about the average waiting time and the duration of each attraction. The dataset has a date range from 01/01/2015 to 08/31/2021.

Besides these, we will also use waiting times for the selected attractions listed in the seperated files. The data is collected on a continuous basis every day, which allows us study the waiting time based on time of the day. The date range is from 01/01/2015 to 12/28/2021.

### Research Questions

1. What is the most popular attraction in Disney World that has the longest waiting time in general?

2. To have a better Disney experience without crowd, which season and which day of the week is the best one to go? What time of a day has the longest waiting time and what time has the shortest?

3. Considering the wait time-duration ratio, does the attraction worth waiting so long?
